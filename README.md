# libp2p-msg ‚úâÔ∏è

This repo includes a set of examples for the exchange of different 
message formats, and sample protocols over libp2p. 
The examples included are widely in different
project and can come pretty handy as a boilerplate for new protocols and projects.

Do not expect production-ready code, but a bunch of dirty code snippets that can help you
get started fast with your libp2p protocol without having to remember all the details from
scratch. 

### Current examples.
- [Generation and exchange of CBOR messages over libp2p](./cbnor-example)
- [Basic structure of a simple request response protocol over lib2p](req-resp-example)
