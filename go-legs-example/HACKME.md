### Notes
- The example has a sample exchange of an index chain.
- It stores the links in a datastore (we can probably use in destination a temporary memory datastore so we don't
have to keep a dedicated datastore in the indexer for ingestion.

### TO DO
- Stop condition is not working. Fix it!
- Clean code
